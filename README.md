### current progress

1. deleting pMod VGA, for ice40 connecting to Pmod VGA, Pmod can be initialized to Pmod VGA directly.

2. Initilzed VGA to intel board directly



### Todo

- [ ] add interface between scala and Defiant
- [x] add pll clock list
- [x] reconfigure the top graph
- [ ] add interface to pong.sv
- [x] add a tentative clock module for board configuration
- [x] add tentative vga interconnect 
- [x] add Sepcifc pin connections for each module
- [x] add interface class for Pmod list
- [x] reconfigure the pmod top and connection module


### Meeting new goals

- [x] design interface type
- [x] design interconnect list
- [x] using standard scala for all different boards
- [ ] Defining the interface class
- [ ] TopApp usage
- [ ] Until usage with Uint but Int is needed
- [ ] Board definition for top

### issues

- [x] How interconnect works?
- [ ] Until usage with Uint but Int is needed
